            "\n",
            "Watering Recommendations:\n",
            "- Ensure the rose plant is receiving adequate water. Water deeply and thoroughly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings.\n",
            "- Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot and further decay. Check the moisture level of the soil before watering.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sunlight Requirements:\n",
            "- Roses generally require at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. Ensure the plant is placed in a location that receives ample sunlight.\n",
            "\n",
            "Soil and Nutrient Needs:\n",
            "- Roses prefer well-draining soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 6.5. Amend the soil with organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, to improve drainage and fertility.\n",
            "- Apply a balanced rose fertilizer according to the package instructions, typically every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pest Control Suggestions:\n",
            "- Inspect the plant regularly for common rose pests such as aphids, spider mites, and rose slugs. Remove any visible pests by hand or use a strong stream of water to dislodge them.\n",
            "- Consider using organic insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils to control pests if the infestation is severe. Follow the product instructions carefully.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other Relevant Care Tips:\n",
            "- Prune any dead or decaying parts of the plant, including the wilted flower. Cut back to healthy tissue using clean and sharp pruning shears.\n",
            "- Improve air circulation around the plant by spacing roses adequately and removing any debris or fallen leaves from the base.\n",
            "- Mulch around the base of the plant with organic materials like wood chips or straw to help retain moisture and suppress weed growth.\n",
            "- Monitor for signs of diseases such as black spot or powdery mildew. If detected, consider using appropriate fungicides or consult with a local garden center for specific recommendations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regular monitoring, proper watering, adequate sunlight, and timely care will help revive the wilting and decaying rose plant.\n"
